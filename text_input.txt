# Death on Shishapangma
Last October, two American women and two Sherpa guides perished while racing for a record. The tragedy raises questions about the recent rush to climb the world's 14 highest mountains.

## I. Four Dead
Around 10:30 A.M. on October 7, 2023, Elena Cebanova's phone rang at her home in Affi, Italy. When the slim, blond mother of two picked up, she learned that her younger sister, 33-year-old Anna Gutu, had been caught in an avalanche in Tibet and was missing.
Elena didn't know much about mountaineering. Her sister had dived headlong into the sport less than two years earlier. She did know that this was an important climb for Anna. If she summited the mountain, she might achieve her dream of becoming the first American woman to climb all 14 of the world's
8,000-meter peaks.
Elena was sure that Anna was OK. Whenever the family worried about her climbing, Anna always told them that she was guided by professionals. Now these people would find her, Elena thought.
An hour and a half later, her phone rang again. The caller spoke English, and Elena, who spoke only Italian and Russian, couldn't follow what he was saying. Her partner opened Google Translate. Using the app, they learned that Anna was dead.
Two hours later, around 8 A.M. Eastern time, a phone rang in a leafy Massachusetts neighborhood. Seventy-five-year-old Susan Rzucidlo picked up. Susan, her cousin said, I'm not sure how to tell you this, but someone called saying that Gina died in an avalanche. I don't know if it's a prank.
This can't be true, Susan thought. She would have gotten a call from the expedition's organizers. She couldn't remember the name of the mountain that her second-eldest daughter was climbing, but she knew that it was in China, because the permitting process had been agonizingly convoluted, and Gina had
waited anxiously for weeks, hoping to beat another woman to the top. So Susan googled something like "most recent avalanche China." And then she saw her daughter's name.
The accidents made international news: Two American women and two Sherpas had perished in a pair of avalanches on Shishapangma, an 8,027-meter peak in Tibet. The climbers, it was reported, had been racing each other to become the first American woman to scale all 14 of the world's 8,000-meter peaks, a
feat widely popularized by 40-year-old Nepali mountaineer Nirmal "Nims" Purja, who in 2019 proved that the mountains—all of them located in the Himalaya and Karakoram Ranges of South Asia—could be climbed in just months. Purja himself had been on the mountain that day; Anna Gutu was a client of his
climbing company, Elite Exped, and had been led by one of its Sherpas, 27-year-old Mingmar Sherpa. Gina Rzucidlo, 45, had been led by a 35-year-old Sherpa named Tenjen "Lama" Sherpa, who earlier that year guided Norway's Kristin Harila, a former professional skier, in a successful attempt to beat
Purja's record. (They trounced it, climbing all the peaks in 92 days.) Both Mingmar and Tenjen died roped to their clients.
Climbers spoke to reporters about what they considered a dangerous trend of record chasing on 8,000-meter peaks, inspired by Purja and Harila and fueled by social media. (Gutu had a sizable Instagram following.) Several of those on the mountain that day were also pursuing their 14th peak; Purja had
been trying to reach a new goal of summiting all of them without supplemental oxygen. Members of the climbing community pointed to recent snowfall that likely worsened the risk of avalanches, and criticized what they said was a failure of leadership on the mountain. But one expedition leader, Mingma
Gyalje Sherpa of Imagine Nepal, known as Mingma G, said that the race was to blame. "Everything was going smoothly," he told a reporter for Explorers Web, "but the competition between the two ladies ruined everything."
Questions remained. Several years ago, one might have been lucky to climb a handful of those peaks in a lifetime. Now two women had ticked off 13 in rapid succession, converging upon the same final mountain on the same day. Who were Gina Rzucidlo and Anna Gutu? How did they end up racing to the roof
of the world? And why did they, and their guides, die?
